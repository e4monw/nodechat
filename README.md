# nodechat
Simple, lightweight node.js chat server and client.

Code is based off the example at the socket.io website.

Sounds by theta4 from freesound.org.



## How to use

Use the branch eamon-mods, that is currently the more active branch.

######How to use
`node app`

The default port is 3000.

```
$ node app
listening on: 8080
Operator password: ****
local address: ***.***.***.***:3000
external address: ***.***.***.***:3000
```

Then go to the address in a browser :)

localhost:8080 works too
